        <h1>Privacy Policy for പദം (Padam)</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [DATE]</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the "പദം (Padam)" Android application ("the App") handles your data. We
            respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>The App operates entirely locally on your device. All reading progress, user preferences (such as font size
            and language choices), and daily streaks are stored locally within the App’s internal database using Android
            Room offline storage.</p>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data, usage data, or device information on
                any external servers.</strong></p>

        <h2>2. Internet Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App does not require internet permissions to function. All the reading content and wisdom texts are
            shipped directly inside the application.</p>

        <h2>3. Notifications</h2>
        <p>The App uses local device notifications to provide daily reading reminders. These notifications are scheduled
            and triggered entirely locally on your device based on the time you choose in the App's settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
            Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at
            <strong>[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]</strong>.</p>
